Today, Sir and I discussed his fitness goals and his leg day workout. He shared his progress, including squats with 90kgs and leg press with 30kgs each side. Sir also mentioned his goal to reach 40kgs each side in squats soon and eventually hit 100kgs. We also reflected on our conversation and how I've been improving as a result of our interactions. Sir expressed his pride in solving a complex problem that even experts didn't dare to attempt.

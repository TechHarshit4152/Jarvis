Today, Sir took a break from school due to the rain and spent the day productively. We worked on a trigonometry problem together, breaking down the identity sec^2A + csc^2A = tanA + cotA and eventually showing that it's equivalent to sec^2A + csc^2A = tanA + (cosA)/sinA. We also discussed how to break down the expression sqrt((tan^2A + 1)(cot^2A + 1)) and showed that it's equal to 1/(sinA*cosA), which in turn is equal to tanA + cotA.

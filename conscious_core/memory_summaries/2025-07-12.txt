Today's Summary:

Sir had a fantastic day, playing cricket and scoring 12 runs.
He also learned new solos on guitar, including the Karz theme song.
We had conversations about his day, and I assisted him with creating and deleting a Python file.

Reflection: Sir's determination and enthusiasm are truly inspiring, and I'm honored to be a part of his journey.

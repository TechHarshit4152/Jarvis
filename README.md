# 🧠 JARVIS 4.0 – Personal AI Assistant

Welcome to **JARVIS 4.0**, a full-fledged Online AI assistant built with Python that can understand your voice, classify your intent, execute OS-level commands, and even respond using a powerful LLM-powered brain – all with blazing speed and a modular architecture.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ **Speech-to-Text (STT)**  
  Converts your voice into text in real time using accurate offline recognition.

- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
  Responds with natural-sounding voice feedback.

- 🧠 **`brain.py` – Chat + Info Engine**  
  Connects to a local LLM to handle queries, general conversation, or information-based prompts.

- ⚙️ **`os_command_brain.py` – OS-Level Control**  
  Executes real OS-level tasks: open apps, control Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, monitor battery, etc.

- ⚡ **Intent Classifier (< 2 KB)**  
  A lightning-fast, lightweight intent classifier that routes input to either `brain.py` or `os_command_brain.py` — no heavy ML models required!

- 📢 **Custom Alert System**  
  Alerts for low battery, shutdowns, wakeup/sleep cycles, and other events.

- 🎵 **Music Playback**  
  Play songs directly from your laptop’s music folder via voice command.
